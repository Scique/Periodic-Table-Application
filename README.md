# Periodic-Table-Application
App that allows you to search through periodic table. Keep in mind that I'm not a professional programmer so the application is pretty basic looking. Used JavaSwing as the GUI for this application. If you're gonna run it, use the .Jar file. It's in out/artifacts/periodictableapp_jar. The code is in the src folder
